# SciencesPo-LegalCollab
Student work on collaborative editing of a legal provision component.

This is an exercise for Megan Ma's class.  We will use the web interface of GitHub to collaboratively edit a "contract" text - terms of agreement among residents in an apartment, a room-mate agreement.  

Students will:

1.  Get a GitHub account - go to [GitHub.com]

2.  "Fork" this repo - (little "Fork" box at the top-right of the repo page https://github.com/CommonAccord/SciencesPo-LegalCollab) into the student's account.  

3.  Rename the appropriate page for the student's section - /UP18540.md by adding something unique for you - /UP18540-Moi.md ....  When editing, feel very free to add additional paragraphs in the page, work on different subjects, or add pages for specific subjects - managing the fridge, noise, mail, paying, ordering food, cleaning, etc. 

4. Make a "pull-request" back to this "master" repo.  (The whole flow of fork, edit, pull-request is nicely demo-ed here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzYPEcwFoqs by the OpenTenancy folks.)

5.  Feel free to ask for help.
